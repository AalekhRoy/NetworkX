# NetworkX
Using NetworkX for Network Analysis

This project is developed as a individual personal project to learn and understand Jupyterlab notebook and NetworkX for Python. I will be using this repository to maintain and share my ipynb file and some CSV file which has network data. This notebook depends upon and draws heavily from the book **Complex Network Analysis in Python *Recognize -> Construct -> Visualize -> Analyze -> Interpret* by Dmitry Zinoviev**.
