# NetworkX
Using NetworkX for Network Analysis

This project is developed as a individual personal project to learn and understand Jupyterlab notebook and NetworkX for Python. I will be using this repository to maintain and share my ipynb file and some CSV file which has network data. This notebook depends upon and draws heavily from the book **Complex Network Analysis in Python *Recognize -> Construct -> Visualize -> Analyze -> Interpret* by Dmitry Zinoviev**.

I take no credit for anypart of the literature and codes used, except some snippets. The only credit I acknowledge for myself is trying my hands on by typing every bit of it.

The motive behind the project is to learn by hands on practice, and try to develop my skills as a data scientist. I am looking forward to learn how to prepare meaningful and insightful Jupyter Notebooks using code as well markdown. Secondly, It will also aid me to learn and practice python basics as well as fundamentals of network analysis using python. I hope it will also be helpful as an overall experience in my journey as a Data Scientist.
